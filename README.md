# CourseMine Online School
 An online school system built with Django.
 I started backend web development with Django a few weeks ago and I'm happy to publish my first app.ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

***Note*** Mobile responsiveness for some pages are very poor, the focus was on the backend.

## Overview
- It is an online school where users sign up as students.
- A person can only enroll in a course if he/she is a registered user(student).
- User dashboard is only visible to users who are logged in. And on the dashboard they can either resume a course they have bought or delete it if they are no longer interested.
